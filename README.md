# build-test-merge-publish

An all in one GitHub Action to install, build, test, and publish npm modules. Supports automatic approval & merging for dependabot PRs. It should be set to run on push events, as well as pull_request_target events (to ensure dependabot PRs can be tested and approved).

## Details

This is a single workflow step to perform a number of common CI actions without lots of boilerplate in your github actions workflow files. The following operations are performed:

* NPM Auth - (Optional) Authenticate with a private npm registry before trying to install dependencies
* NPM Install - Install dependencies
  For dependabot PRs, we first check out the PR head commit to do the npm install, then we go back to the PR base to run the workflow. 
* Compile - (Optional) Compile source js/ts/whatever into a build artifact
* Test - Run your unit/int/whatever tests
* Approve - (Optional) If the action is triggered by a dependabot PR, automatically approve the PR once the compile and test steps have completed
* Enable Auto Merge - (Optional) If the action is triggered by a dependabot PR, automatically enable the auto merge option on the PR so that GitHub will merge when all pre requisites are satisfied
* Publish - When a commit is pushed to the main branch and compile and test steps have completed, run an automated release (for example using semantic release)

| main-branch          | Branch to release from                            | false    | main            |
| merge-method         | Method to use to merge dependabot PRs             | false    | REBASE          |
| private-npm-registry | Private registry to auth with for install/publish | false    |                 |

## Required Environment Variables

* GITHUB_TOKEN - this can't be the built in token or the action will be unable to create releases, approve PRs, etc. You'll need to create a GitHub personal access token and save that as a repository secret
* NPM_TOKEN - this is set as an environment variable for use when running the release command, make sure your release command is expecting this env var and you should be good to go
